    description: `Throughout history, God has been looking for faithful men and women.
                In the story of David, we meet a man God found. Throughout David’s life,
                we learn about the riches of God’s grace, the heights of God’s love,
                the depths of His patience, the trauma of our sin, and the dependability
                of God’s Promises. David was a good man. But he was also a sinful man.
                He loved God, served God, obeyed God, and worshiped God. He also failed
                God … a lot. At times he sought God, and, at other times, he seemed to
                avoid Him. In the end, the hero of this story isn’t David. Maybe the
                times when David forgot that are the moments of his deepest failures.
                The story of David is a story about God. It’s a story about a seeking,
                loving, holy, and faithful God. God saw David. He saw David’s humility
                in his obscurity, and He saw David’s arrogance in his prominence.
                Through everything and despite everything, God loved David, sought
                David, chose David, and used David. Believers today can be encouraged
                that God wants to do the same for us. He loves you, is seeking you, is
                calling you, and wants to use you. The question you must answer is:
                What will it take for you to become a man or a woman after God’s heart?`

    description: `Being a pastor is an audacious calling—both a remarkable privilege
                and an unaccomplishable task. In general, the Bible talks about
                the identity of a shepherd more than the activity of a shepherd.
                Yet both are vital in ministry. Ezekiel 34 is God’s message to
                pastors: His template by which our ministries will be measured.
                Pastoral Ministry brings together this mandate of God, the needs
                of the sheep, and the model of the good Shepherd to uniquely
                inspire and equip you to fulfill your ministry as a shepherd.`

  //   description: `Technology has changed every facet of our lives. It is even
  //               changing the face of education (and sometimes for the better). We
  //               live in a day where information is considered EQUIVALENT to
  //               instruction; where the accumulation of data is misinterpreted as
  //               education. This is the consummate challenge of our time. And
  //               nowhere is this more significant than in theological education. We
  //               are the defenders of higher learning, critical thinking, spiritual
  //               heritage, and Biblical exegesis. It may be counter-cultural; it
  //               may be uncool; it may be antiquated; but it is the task with which
  //               we have been entrusted. And the impact of our success will imprint
  //               a generation!`
