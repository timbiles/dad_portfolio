    description: `Being a pastor is an audacious calling—both a remarkable privilege
                and an unaccomplishable task. In general, the Bible talks about
                the identity of a shepherd more than the activity of a shepherd.
                Yet both are vital in ministry. Ezekiel 34 is God’s message to
                pastors: His template by which our ministries will be measured.
                Pastoral Ministry brings together this mandate of God, the needs
                of the sheep, and the model of the good Shepherd to uniquely
                inspire and equip you to fulfill your ministry as a shepherd.`

    description: `Technology has changed every facet of our lives. It is even
                changing the face of education (and sometimes for the better). We
                live in a day where information is considered EQUIVALENT to
                instruction; where the accumulation of data is misinterpreted as
                education. This is the consummate challenge of our time. And
                nowhere is this more significant than in theological education. We
                are the defenders of higher learning, critical thinking, spiritual
                heritage, and Biblical exegesis. It may be counter-cultural; it
                may be uncool; it may be antiquated; but it is the task with which
                we have been entrusted. And the impact of our success will imprint
                a generation!`
